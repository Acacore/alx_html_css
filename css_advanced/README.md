## Overview

SmileSchool is a web-based learning platform that offers free and premium membership options, a variety of tutorials, student testimonials, pricing plans, a contact form, membership benefits, results statistics, an FAQ section, and social media integration. The site is built with HTML and CSS, ensuring a clean, modern design with a purple accent theme (#c50ebf) and gray text (#a1a1a1).
